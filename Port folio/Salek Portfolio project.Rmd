## Install and Load Necessary Libraries

# Install necessary libraries (run only if not installed)
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("corrplot")
install.packages("car")
install.packages("pROC")

# Load libraries

```

## Load and Inspect Data

```{r}
# Load dataset
data <- read.csv("D:\\COURSE PAID\\R Batch Naim Vai\\Portfolio project\\Dataset\\diabetes - diabetes.csv")

# View first few rows
head(data)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(data))

# Summary statistics
summary(data)

```

## Interpretation:

The dataset is loaded successfully, and the first few rows are displayed to get an initial understanding of the structure of the data. We also check for missing values to ensure that the dataset is complete. The summary statistics provide an overview of the key variables in the dataset.

## Problem Statement 1: Blood Pressure vs. BMI

```{r}
# Scatter plot of Blood Pressure vs. BMI
ggplot(data, aes(x = BloodPressure, y = BMI)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = "#1f77b4", size = 2) +  # Better contrast blue
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "#d62728", linewidth = 1.5, linetype = "solid") + # Red regression line
  labs(
    title = "Association Between Blood Pressure and BMI",
    x = "Blood Pressure (mm Hg)",
    y = "BMI (kg/mÂ²)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +  # Larger base font size for readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18, hjust = 0.5), # Centered, bold title
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16), # Bold axis titles
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14), # Larger axis text
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray80", linetype = "dashed"), # Subtle grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()  # Remove minor grid lines
  )

```

## Interpretation:

The scatter plot reveals the relationship between blood pressure and BMI. The regression line, in red, suggests a positive correlation between these two variables. As blood pressure increases, BMI also tends to increase, which is expected given the health implications of both high blood pressure and obesity.

## Problem Statement 2: Factors Affecting Glucose Levels

```{r}
# Compute the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(data[, c("Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI", "Age", "DiabetesPedigreeFunction")], 
                  use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize the correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = "color",        # Use colored visualization
         col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(200),  # Blue to Red gradient
         addCoef.col = "black",   # Add correlation values in black
         tl.cex = 1,              # Adjust text label size
         number.cex = 0.8,        # Adjust correlation coefficient text size
         order = "hclust",        # Hierarchical clustering for better arrangement
         diag = FALSE)            # Hide diagonal

```

## Interpretation:

The correlation matrix shows the relationships between different factors and glucose levels. We observe moderate correlations between glucose levels and factors like BMI and insulin. These insights could guide future investigations into how various factors impact glucose levels.

## linear regression analysis to predict glucose levels based on multiple predictors.

```{r}
# Linear regression to predict glucose levels
glucose_model <- lm(Glucose ~ BloodPressure + SkinThickness + Insulin + BMI + Age + DiabetesPedigreeFunction, data = data)
summary(glucose_model)

# Check VIF for multicollinearity
vif(glucose_model)

```

## Interpretation:

The linear regression model predicts glucose levels based on multiple variables. The summary output shows the significance of each predictor. Variables like BMI and insulin have significant relationships with glucose levels. The VIF values indicate the absence of multicollinearity, suggesting that the predictors are not highly correlated with each other.

## Problem Statement 3: Most Important Factor for Diabetes Risk

```{r}
# Ensure Diabetes is a Binary Factor
data$Diabetes <- as.numeric(data$Diabetes == "Yes")

# Run Logistic Regression
diabetes_model <- glm(Diabetes ~ Pregnancies + Glucose + BloodPressure + SkinThickness + Insulin + BMI + Age + DiabetesPedigreeFunction, 
                      data = data, family = binomial)

summary(diabetes_model)

```

## Interpretation:

The logistic regression model identifies key predictors of diabetes risk. The summary() function provides the odds ratios and p-values for each variable, helping us understand how strongly each factor contributes to the likelihood of diabetes. For example, glucose levels and BMI are strong predictors of diabetes risk.

## the most significant factor for diabetes risk.

```{r}
# Find the Most Significant Predictor
most_significant <- names(coef(diabetes_model))[which.min(summary(diabetes_model)$coefficients[, 4])]
print(paste("The most significant factor influencing diabetes risk is:", most_significant))

```

## Interpretation:

The most significant factor influencing diabetes risk is identified. This helps us prioritize interventions and risk assessments for the identified factor, such as glucose levels or BMI.

```{r}
# Get the predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model
pred_prob <- predict(diabetes_model, type = "response")

# Compute the ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(data$Diabetes, pred_prob)

# Plot the ROC curve
plot(roc_curve, 
     main = "ROC Curve for Diabetes Risk Prediction", 
     col = "#1f77b4", 
     lwd = 2, 
     cex.main = 1.5, 
     cex.lab = 1.2)

# Add AUC to the plot
text(0.6, 0.2, paste("AUC =", round(auc(roc_curve), 3)), cex = 1.5, col = "red")

```

## Interpretation:

The ROC curve evaluates the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting diabetes risk. The area under the curve (AUC) provides a measure of how well the model distinguishes between diabetes and non-diabetes cases. A high AUC indicates that the model performs well in making predictions.

## Conclusion

This report provides insights into the factors affecting blood pressure, BMI, glucose levels, and diabetes risk. We used statistical models and visualizations to uncover significant relationships and predictors. Further analysis could delve deeper into specific predictors or apply more advanced models for improved predictions.
